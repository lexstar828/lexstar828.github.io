        <p>The length of the snowboard will pave the way to how you advance as a rider. It is key for a begginer rider to
            choose the right board based on his weight. Each weight category has a slight range of boards from shorter
            to longer.</p>  
            <p>While the shorter boards will be easier to spin and maneuver, the slightly longer board will provide
            more stability: an important plus for a begginer. </p>
