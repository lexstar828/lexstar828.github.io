            <h3>LENGTH</h3>
            <p>The length of the snowboard will pave the way to how you advance as a rider. It is key for a begginer rider to
                choose the right board based on his weight. Each weight category has a slight range of boards from shorter
                to longer. While the shorter boards will be easier to spin and maneuver, the slightly longer board will provide
                more stability: an important plus for a begginer. </p>
